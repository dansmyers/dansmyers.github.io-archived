## About the Recordings

I've played and enjoyed many kinds of music over the more than twenty years that I've been a serious musician, but for the last ten my main focus has been playing old-time music on the guitar.

These home recordings are a few of my solo guitar arrangements of traditional old-time tunes. All the tunes are played with a pick and there is no accompaniment or overdubbing

The modern genre of old-time music has its roots in both the traditional music of rural people from the Southern Appalachians and the first generation of commercial country music recordings made between the World Wars. Songs, ballads, and religious music are all part of the tradition, but the core of the style is in instrumental tunes. Many, but not all, of these tunes were traditionally used as accompaniments for square and contra dancing.

The tunes I play come from various sources. Some are from contemporary musicians that I admire, like the banjo players Dwight Diller and Adam Hurt. Others are from field recordings of old players born in the late-1800's, and some are from books and written tune collections.

These arrangements are a mixture of traditional flatpicking and my own approach. Like a clawhammer banjo player, I'm picking both the tune's melody and a rhythm part at the same time. This requires playing in non-standard tunings and a lot of fancy picking to mix melody notes on the low strings with the rhythmic drone played on the guitar's top string.
