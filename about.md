I am an Assistant Professor of Computer Science at [Rollins College](http://www.rollins.edu).

My research interests include performance analytics, queueing theory, and applications of AI to operations research.
Some of my recent projects include developing a new
course timetabling system for Rollins and implementing a web-based adaptive system for teaching
coding literacy to new programmers.

My teaching interests span the computer science curriculum, but I currently specialize in computer systems,
including security and networking. I lead general education courses through the 
[Innovate, Create, Elevate (ICE)](http://www.rollins.edu/rollins-foundations-liberal-arts/neighborhoods/innovate-create-elevate.html)
neighborhood, part of the [Rollins Foundations in the Liberal Arts (rFLA) curriculum](http://www.rollins.edu/rollins-foundations-liberal-arts
index.html).

In 2015, I offered a new course in tech entrepreneurship that combined programming,
business, and a scientific approach to launching new ventures. In 2016-2017, I am serving as 
"Mayor" of the ICE neighborhood and leading the first edition of our new general education capstone,
applying agile development concepts to interdisciplinary projects.

I received the Ph.D. in Computer Sciences in 2014 from the [University of 
Wisconsin-Madison](http://www.cs.wisc.edu), advised by [Mary Vernon](http://cs.wisc.edu/~vernon) and 
[Remzi Arpaci-Dusseau](http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~remzi). My dissertation developed analytic 
performance models for back-end storage systems and new approximations for multi-server queueing systems. 
This project was inspired by an internship I completed at 
[Google Madison](https://www.google.com/about/locations/madison/).

Before attending UW-Madison, I
worked as a software engineer at 
[Sandia National Laboratories](http://www.sandia.gov) in Albuquerque, NM, with 
teams applying image processing and computer vision algorithms to national security problems.

I occasionally compete in old-time and bluegrass guitar contests, and I've received first prizes
at the Florida Old-Time Music Championship and the Santa Fe Bluegrass Festival. My music was profiled in *Frets* 
magazine in 2006. I also enjoy [shape-note singing](http://www.fasola.org) and gospel music.

I grew up in Kingsport, TN and Miami, FL, then studied computer engineering at the 
University of Florida, where I met my wife, Chelsea. We have two kids and a minivan.
