I'm leading three classes this semester:

  - Two sections of CMS 230: Introduction to Computer Systems
  - The new general education capstone course, ICE 300: Creating the Future

The computer systems class is an intro to computer architecture, assembly language
programming, and several important systems concepts, including caching
and performance evaluation. New for this year, I'm building the class
around the [Raspberry Pi](http://www.raspberrypi.org) and its ARM
architecture.

Notes and documentation for the systems class are 
[available on GitHub](http://github.com/dansmyers/IntroductionToComputerSystems).

The capstone is an interdisciplinary project-based class. Rather than
a specific topic or subject, the organizing theme will be development
using an agile, iterative process. I'll write a future post once 
we're further into the semester describing how this works.
