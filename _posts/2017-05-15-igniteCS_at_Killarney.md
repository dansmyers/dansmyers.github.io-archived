An exciting update on our igniteCS initiative!


I'm happy to report that we will be partnering with [Killarney
Elementary](https://killarneyes.ocps.net) during the next
academic year. 

Following the closure of Fern Creek Elementary School at the end
of this academic year, the program is in need of a new home. Killarney
is an excellent school with great leadership and a place where our
program can continue to make a positive impact on the community.

We are also looking forward to continuing our relationship with
[Google](http://ignitecs.withgoogle.com).

If you're a member of the Rollins community interested in participating,
please feel free to get in touch. We welcome all students to serve as
mentors, including those with no previous programming experience.
