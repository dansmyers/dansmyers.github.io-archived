This semester nine Rollins students led by Sam Sadeh, a computer science major, have been leading an after-school computer science mentoring program at Fern Creek Elementary School in Orlando. The program is funded by a grant from Google through their [igniteCS initiative](https://ignitecs.withgoogle.com). I'm the faculty advisor on the project.

[A profile of Sam and the program](https://360.rollins.edu/people/igniting-kids-imagination-through-computer-science) is now up on the Rollins 360 website. I'm also interviewed in the article. Here's a short excerpt:

>Programming your electronic cat to walk toward cheesy puffs on a computer screen? Boring.
>
>A magical wizard vaporizing those tasty treats instead? Awesome!
>
>For Sam Sadeh ’18 and his fourth-grade mentees at Fern Creek Elementary School, success can be measured in the silliest of scenarios—like >when kids go off script to let their imaginations run wild.
>
> “The aha moment is when they take it miles beyond whatever I could have dreamed up in the lesson plan,” says Sadeh, a computer science >major and social entrepreneurship minor. “The beauty of coding is the creative problem-solving, and these kids are definitely creative.”
>
> This spring, as part of an $1,100 grant through Google’s igniteCS initiative, Sadeh and eight Rollins classmates have used MIT’s child- > friendly Scratch software to teach the basics of coding to students in Fern Creek’s after-school program
>
> I'm tremendously proud of the leadership our students have shown and what they've accomplished so far. Fern Creek will be closing at the > end of this academic year, but we're looking forward to continuing the program at new home next year.
